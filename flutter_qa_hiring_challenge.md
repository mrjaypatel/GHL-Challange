# Motivation
The GHL Mobile Application is built with flutter, in the dart programming language.
Flutter comes with its own hamcrest-inspired matcher-type testing framework and an integration test driver.

If you join the Mobile Team as an SDET, your work will be:

1. Adding more test cases to testrail, increasing our regression test coverage and building up our regression test suite
2. Automating these tests with the integeration test drivers and commiting these tests directly to the repository
3. On every potential release candidate, perform end-to-end regression testing including manually testing all the cases which are not covered by automation suite of integration tests

Apart from this, you will be:
* helping developers figure out on how to unit test certain scenarios and help them get into a TDD discipline
* working with the support team on bugs, and helping developers identify a path to reliable reproduction of the issue
* dissecting support tickets, and modifying/adding testrail specs as well as automated integration tests


If you have come to this stage, we have already validated your knack for finding and documenting cases and other forms of functional testing. While we don't expect you to already know a lot of flutter / dart, we want you to be comfortable with the idea of programming test cases. 
We also want you to have a basic familiarity of how these frameworks work before you commit to doing this daily.

# Stages
This exercise is divided into multiple stages:

0. An introduction to the dart programming language
    * [Get the Dart Programming Language](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
    * [Dart Language Tour ](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour)
1. Complete setting up flutter on your machine
    * [Flutter Setup](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) 
    * [Taking Flutter For a Spin](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive)
2. Get a basic idea of building flutter apps with a codelab: [HERE](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0)
3. Get a basic idea of how tests work on a flutter app with a one part codelab
    * [Introduction to tests in flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing)
    * [More about Integration Testing with Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests)
    * [Practical: Integration Testing Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-app-testing#0)
4. Get on a call with a hiring manager from the Mobile Team and talk about your experience through this exercise

# Outcome
The key outcome is for you to get an idea of how the framework works before you commit to working with it.
For us, it is to find out whether you are comfortable with the learning curve before we have you on our team.
